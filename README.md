# Wordle-Solver by Alex Tomsovic

Hi and welcome to my wordle solver. I found a file of all the (supposid) words on wordle and implemented them into the program.

How to use:

1. Enter your phrase into wordle.
2. Input your letter for each index as well as the color returned
3. You will receive a list of possible words. If your guess was incorrect the first try, enter No.
4. Enter your second phrase into wordle and repeat process.
5. You will eventually be left with only one word. That will be the correct word.
6. Have fun.

PLEASE NOTE: This program was inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video on solving wordle's puzzles using information theory. 
While the program's code is written by me, I am not the originator of this concept. I included a link to his video below, 
I highly reccomend watching!
